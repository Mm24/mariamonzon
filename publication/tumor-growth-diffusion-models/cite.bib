  abstract  = "Abstract BACKGROUND Pediatric diffuse midline glioma (DMG) has a
               poor prognosis with radiotherapy as the standard of palliative
               care. Radiation strategies using individual geometric
               doseshaping have the potential to maximize patient benefit. This
               study aimed to establish a proof-of-principle to generate
               clinically relevant anatomical representations of the
               progression of pediatric DMG magnetic resonance image (MRI)
               slices through denoising diffusion implicit models (DDIM).
               METHODS Based on the BraTS23 data, we analyzed the generation of
               MRIs with enlarged tumor sizes starting from a baseline scan.
               Models were pre-trained on adult glioblastoma (GBM) prior to
               transfer learning on pediatric high-grade glioma. Test set
               performance was evaluated using the Frechet Inception Distance
               (FID), and Structural Similarity Index (SSIM). Qualitative
               evaluation involved visual classification of real vs generated
               images by two independent radiology trainees. The optimized
               network was tested to forecast anatomical tumor growth in five
               DMG patients from an independent dataset comprising longitudinal
               T2-FLAIR images. RESULTS We obtain high-fidelity generated
               images, supported by an FID of 12.4 and 0.8 SSIM on the adult
               test set. Despite the smaller pediatric BraTS dataset yielding a
               34.8 FID and 0.84 SSIM, human observers failed to distinguish
               generated from real MRIs (mean recall and precision of 0.51).
               The generated anatomical predictions also closely resemble the
               observed longitudinal tumor progression in the pediatric DMG
               subset. Notably, the direction and extent of tumor growth align
               while the surrounding brain anatomy is preserved.
               Quantitatively, the mean DICE score between segmentations of
               generated and real tumors was 0.8. CONCLUSIONS Our model
               produces high-quality images that conform to growth patterns of
               pediatric DMGs. Further quantitative validation on larger
               longitudinal datasets is required, to ensure the method's
               robustness. The proposed method enables a personalized approach
               for defining target regions in radiation therapy which could
               translate to improved clinical outcomes.",
