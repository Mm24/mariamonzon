The model that classify 2-second audio samples is a small convolutional neural network. Sound classification is a machine learning task where you input some sound to a machine learning model to categorize it into predefined categories such as singing and speech. There are already many applications of sound classification.\nDataset The first step to develop the model is to find a suitable dataset. For the siging database, the\nNUS-48E Sung and Spoken Corpus developed at Sound and Music Computing Laboratory at National University of Singapore was used. The corpus is a 169-min collection of audio recordings of the sung and spoken lyrics of 48 (20 unique) English songs by 12 subjects and a complete set of transcriptions and duration annotations at the phone-level for all recordings of sung lyrics, comprising 25,474 phone instances.\nThe training datasetwas further pre-process by convert them to the WAV format and splitting them in 2 seconds window.\nComparison of spectrogram of a spoken lyrics and its corresponding singing signal for the sentence ‘I believe that the heart does go on’ Adapted from [1] For the background samples, the dataset was complemented with the ESC-50 dataset. ESC-50 consist of a labeled collection of 2000 environmental audio recordings suitable for benchmarking methods of environmental sound classification. The dataset consists of 5-second-long recordings organized into 50 semantical classes (with 40 examples per class) loosely arranged into 5 major categories:\nModel The proof-of-concept model is just a basic 1D CNN model. The model receives a 1D time representation of sound. It first processes the time eries with successive layers of 2D convolution (Conv1D) bi-layers with ReLU activations.\nThe model ends in a number of dense (fully-connected) layers, which are interleaved with dropout layers for the purpose of reducing overfitting during training. The final output of the model is an array of probability scores, one for each class of sound the model is trained to recognize. The model was trained on Google Collab to take advantage of free GPU. For the integration into the app, the trained model was deployed with TensorFlow Lite.\nApp Deployment Android sample app was the starting point to design the custom app. It enables to acquire the microphone data for over 2 seconds when tiping the record button.\nReferences [1] Gao, X., Sisman, B., Das, R., \u0026amp; Vijayan, K.

Despite the high freedom of the human hand movements, most actions of daily life can be executed incorporating only palmar, lateral and grasp. Recent studies have already shown that neural correlates of natural reach-and-grasp actions can be identified in the EEG [1][2].\nDeep Learning has recently achieved promising results in the field of Computer Vision and Biomedical Engineering. Therefore, this work aims to study the possibility of develop Deep learning based decoders to classify grasp actions based on EEG signals. We have also studied the possibility of developing intersubject classifiers and transfer learning between the different subject technologies. For this purpose, different neural network architectures have been tested, single trial vs crop trial performance has been evaluated as well as the different training techniques: within-subject and inter-subject training.\n1-EEG Introduction The EEG is a cost-effective, non-invasive technique to examine brain activity linked to multiple neurocognitive processes that underlie human behavior. It consists of placing electrodes on the head to monitor the electrical activity produced when neurons fire. The EEG records and measures electrical signals of the human brain from multiple cortical areas. Therefore, EEG monitoring allows to quantify different types of brain waves, also known as neural oscillations. The standard pipeline followed to extract information is depicted in the next figure:\nEEG standard decoding pipeline. Adapted from Bitbrain. ‘Three important steps when processing EEG’, April 23, 2020, https://www.bitbrain.com/blog/ai-eeg-data-processing 2-Dataset In a cue-guided experiment, 15 healthy individuals were asked to perform reach-and-grasp actions using daily life objects. The dataset is publicly available at BNCI Horizon 2020. The pre-recorded dataset contains 7 min runs, leading to 80 trials per condition (TPC) distributed over 4 runs / 20 trials for each reach-and-grasp condition and from a no-movement condition. The 45 right handed participants performed two self-initiated reach-and-grasp (palmar and lateral grasp) movement conditions.\nReach and Grasp movement decoding from EEG with gel, water and dry electrodes dataset experimental set-up 2 Gel-based electrodes recordings. EEG was measured with 58 electrodes (frontal, central and parietal areas). Water-based electrodes recordings mobile and water-based electrodes EEG-Versatile™ system with 32 electrodes Dry-electrodes recordings measured using the dry-electrodes EEG-Hero™ headset. EEG was measured with 11 electrodes over the sensorimotor cortex. Data Proprocesssing The EEG data processsing was analogous to the one in [2]. All the modalities data were filtered with a zero-phase 4th order Butterworth filter with a cut-off frequency of 0.3 and resample to 128 Hz. We defined a window of interest for each movement trial of [-2 3] s with respect to the movement onset at second 0. In addition, we also extracted 81 rest trials from inactivity periods with a duration of 5 seconds.\n3-Methods Vanilla 1D Network We aimed to design a single convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture to accurately classify grasp actions from differente EEG decoding modalitites, while being as compact and simple as possible. We try a simple vanilla 1D convolutional neural network based on 1D temporal convolutions in order to encapsulate EEG feature extraction methodologies used in traditional classiers [2] Overview of 1D CNN designed architecture. It contains a 1D convolution block layer followed by a temporal pooling and convolution kernel to extract features that are the input for the dense layer EEGNet [3] EEGNet is a compact CNN designed for BCIs that can be trained with very limited data. The architecture has three convolution layers:\na one-dimensional convolution analogous to temporal band-pass filtering a depthwise convolution to perform spatial filtering, a separable convolution to identify temporal patterns across the previous filters HTNet architecture [4] HTNet builds upon EEGNet [3]. The authors added a Hilbert transform layer after this initial temporal convolution to compute relevant spectral power features using a data-driven filter-Hilbert. The temporal convolution and Hilbert transform layers generate data-driven spectral features that can then be projected from electrodes onto common regions of interest using a predefined weight matrix.\nTraining Strategies Transfer learning techniques from the field of machine learning have been adopted also for EEG feature distribution for inter-subject variability. The common cross-validation strategy used in EEG decoding is known as “leave one-subject-out”.

Therefore, the problem can be well modeled as a discrete-time Markov Decision Processes. The approach follow was:\nImplement a reinforcement-learning based algorithm The robot is the agent and decides where to place the next part Use the markov decision process toolbox for your solution Choose the best performing MDP Defitinions The basic concepts to understand the promblem are shortly introduced based on Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach book:\nReinforcement learning: Type of dynamic programming that trains algorithms using a system of reward and punishment. The agent learns without intervention from a human by maximizing its reward and minimizing its penalty and updates itself continuously. The algorithm it automatically finds patterns and relationships inside of that dataset. It requires realtime data.\nAgent: A is the set of all possible moves the agent can make. An action is almost self-explanatory, but it should be noted that agents choose among a list of possible actions.\nEnvironment: The world through which the agent moves. The environment takes the agent’s current state and action as input, and returns as output the agent’s reward and its next state.\nState: The parameter values that describe the current cofiguration of the environment, which the agent uses to choose an action. A state is a concrete and immediate situation in which the agent finds itself; i.e. a specific place and moment.\nReward: Feedback by which we effectively evaluate the agent’s action. From any given state, an agent sends output in the form of actions to the environment, and the environment returns the agent’s new state (which resulted from actingon the previous state) as well as rewards, if any. Rewards can be immediate or delayed.\nMarkov decision process: Markov decision processes (MDPS) is a model decision making in stochastic, sequential environments. The essence of the model is that a decision maker, or agent, inhabits an environment, which changes state randomly in response to action choices made by the agent. Example Introduction A tiny warehouse with (2x2) storage capacity locations is simulated. The picking robot (agent) interacts with the warehouse (environment) by store-restoring items in each warehouse cell or shelve. The dataset contains store and restore action for red, blue and white colored items although an empty field is also possible.\nWhen the agent is placed on a field position (𝑥𝑑, 𝑦𝑑), it can either store or restore each of the color items. There exists a total of six possible actions to change its environment. The robot can move in the (2x2) grid environment and start moving at initial grid position (1,1) . The robot is constrained to always to move only to one adjacent fields (not in diagonal).\nThe distance the robot needs to move is derived based on current (𝑥𝑐 , 𝑦𝑐 ) and goal position (𝑥𝑑 , 𝑦𝑑). The distance is calculated as the sum of the absolute differences of the layout position $$ 𝑑 = |𝑥_𝑑 − 𝑥_𝑐 | + |𝑦_𝑑 − 𝑦_𝑑|$$ Therefore, the distance to the position can be assigned to the cost of the action or negative reward. The ideal goal of the reinforcement learning approach would be to optimize the route picking storage strategy by minimizing the distance with rewards the store/restore motion actions.\nMethods The Markov Discrete Process (MDP) algorithm was implemented for modelling the problem. A MDP is described by state transition probabilities. A general Reinforcement Learning and thus also MDP algorithm is defined with a set of variables:\nActions (A): refers to the operations an agent can perform which direct modify the environment. In our problem this are related to the effect on the warehouse grid cells, directly proportional to the warehouse size (𝑋, 𝑌). $ A = \\{ 𝐴_{(1,1)}, 𝐴_{(1,2)}, 𝐴_{(2,1)}, … , 𝐴_{(X,Y)}\\}$ where $ |𝐴| = |𝑋 \\cdot 𝑌|$ .\nStates (S): represent all the possible configuration of environment, i.e, how the items are storage in the warehouse grid. In the addressed problem, the total states can be computed $ |S| = \\{𝑖𝑡𝑒𝑚𝑠_{𝑔𝑟𝑖𝑑}*move_{action} \\}$ where the items on the grid is calculated as the exponential relation of colored items number to grid size, and the move actions represent all the possible robot movements {store: blue/red/white, restore: blue/red/white }.\nTransition probability matrix (TMP) in Markov processes stores the probability to transition from the current state to a next possible state after the agent has performed given action in a single time unit. The dimension if this matrix is determined by (|𝐴|,|𝑆|,|𝑆|).\nReward matrix (R), is composed by the defined reward or symbolic benefit received performing and action 𝐴(𝑥,𝑦) for a given state.

The objective this thesis 1 was to evaluate deep learning-based landmarks tracking methods to extract the motion of the mitral valves throughout the cardiac cycle on time-resolved CMR four-chamber- view (4CHV) images. The fully automated CNN based algorithm would improve the current slice following acquisition workflow, which needs from manual user intervention. The automatic imaging slice tracking will enable a more precise morphology and flow estimation, potentially improving the diagnosis of diastolic dysfunction. During this project, an automatic deep learning algorithm using landmark detection was developed.\nMotivation Cardio-vascular diseases remain the leading cause of death worldwide [1]. In particular, diastolic dys- function is an important cause of cardiac insufficiency, heart failure, potentially leading to premature cardiovascular death if not diagnosed and treated for at an early disease stage. Left ventricular dias- tolic dysfunction is estimated to affect from 27% to 43% in middle-aged adults [2] and its prevalence increases with age.\nDiastolic dysfunction is defined as a malfunctioning filling of the heart during diastole [3]. Its diag- nostic remains challenging as not only structural but functional abnormalities need to be evaluated [4]. Several non-invasive imaging techniques have been used for assessing diastolic dysfunction. Typically, intra-cardiac haemodynamics are measured using Doppler echocardiography. The peak velocities during early diastolic filling (E wave) and atrial contraction (A wave) are measured, and their ratio is calculated [5]. The Doppler flow measures are influenced by multiple factors including age, valve heart diseases, heart rate. Therefore, no single parameter is determinant enough to asses diastolic dysfunction [6].\nMagnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a noninvasive technique, well suited for disease diagnosis and monitoring due to its high spatial and temporal resolution and excellent soft-tissue contrast. In- deed, Cardiac Magnetic Resonance (CMR) provides information about heart structure and function, particularly in soft tissue characterization without the need of any contrast agent. Furthermore, CMR is useful for characterizing the anatomic valve morphology and cine images allows to visualize the valve throughout the cardiac cycle [7, 8]. Indeed, CMR allows assessment of blood flow using phase-contrast MRI (PC-MRI) [9].\nAs the valves move during a cardiac cycle, the acquisition of a fixed 2D slice will not allow the accurate time-resolved visualization of the valve and quantification of the blood flow: The valve moves into and out of the MRI slice so cannot be seen on each cardiac phase, therefore, the quantified flow through the valve is not correct. Despite the importance of correct valve flow assessment, time resolved CMR is yet usually performed at fixed slice positions throughout the cardiac cycle Kozerke et al. [10] introduced the prospective slice tracking concept. If the valve motion is known prior to the examina- tion, the slice position can be updated for each cardiac phase. As this approach however requires a dedicated pre-scan including an image-based algorithm to quantify the valve motion, very few related work can be found applying this technique in a clinical setting.\nThe recent development of deep learning has led to significant improvements in medical image analysis [11]. The prominent algorithms for feature tracking include deep learning systems based on convolutional neural network architectures. Specifically, for valve-tracking, a deep learning feature tracking algorithm for automatic slice-tracking can be developed, overcoming many limitations of the current valve-tracking techniques. The imaging slice tracking will enable a more precise morphology and flow estimation, potentially improving the diagnosis of diastolic dysfunction.\nDataset The dataset is composed of Cardiac Magnetic Resonance Imaging 4CHV CINE series from 87 patients extracted from the Cardiac Atlas Project [Fon11]. The imaging protocol included CINE images acquired in long-axis planes, but for our work we only selected the 4CHV long axis view. The sequence of 4CHV CINE CMR are acquired on multiple 1.5T MRI scanners from different vendors (Philips, Siemens, GE). The mean pixel spacing of all selected datasets is 1.49 + 0.28 mm/pixel.

Naive Bayes is a statistical classification technique based on Bayes probability theorem, considered as one most basic supervised learning algorithm. Naive Bayes classifier assumes that the features in a class are independent of other features. The followed approach to implement the classifier can be is based on the standard steps of Machine Learning (ML) algorithms: data exploration and preprocessing, feature selection and transformation, classifier model definition and training. The final phase of the assignment is dedicated for results visualization and evaluation.\nData exploration and preprocessing The essential first step is to import the dataset files into the python program, loaded as a pandas DataFrame data structure. The next step performed was a data quality assessment by printing the header columns, missing values datatypes and a short overview of the data samples. Furthermore, the unique values of each field as well as the label frequencies are printed to determine if the dataset suffers from class imbalance. As a quality assessment result, data cleaning procedures were performed. The missing values were substituted the missing values with 0, to minimize the effect of these on the accuracy of the model. For the text fields, the data was standardized by removing capital, special and/or punctuation characters, German stopwords and 2 or a single character-words. Finally, the sentences were splitted into single words (tokenize). After the data cleaning and preprocessing, to check if the process was done successfully, a final data inspection and a summary of the dataset by class was depicted. A secondary reason for the data inspection was to have an insight of the feature’s distributions and outlier identification.\nFeature transformation Feature transformation refers to translating the data into an appropriate format allowing the ML model to learn from the data. For instance, categorical data need to be converted to numerical data for the Naïve Bayes classifier. The categorical labels were converted to values ranged between 0-5. A common step in ML is also feature selection, i.e selection of the features in dataset hypothesized to be the most descriptive. Therefore, all the numeric values were scaled between the range 0-1 to reduce the variance. The string features were vectorized and concatenated to create the feature matrix. The final feature dimension was 502. As an optional step, a model selector of the best K features was also implemented for feature dimensionality reduction.\nModel Training The selected classifier model is a Multinomial Naïve bayes classifier implemented in the sklearn library. As only few data samples were available in the dataset, a cross validation scheme has been used for training and evaluation. The data was splitted in k=10 folds and with stratified sampling to mitigate the class imbalance. Note that even the predict phase was done in after fitting the classifier on the KFold iteration, but this does not interfere in the training process.\nEvaluation and Result visualization As stated previously, the data samples present in the datasheet are not many to test the robustness of the classifier a cross validation scheme has been used for evaluation. For each class, the predicted probabilities are plotted in the next figure. The probabilities for each sample are close to 1, which resembles the a extreme probability assignament of Naïve Bayes Classifier.\nIn order to quantified the performance of the classifier, many quantitative metrics were computed. The most common evaluation method in classification is the so-called confusion matrix. The Matrix is represented for a binary classification although it can be extended to multiclass problem. The matrix represents the relation between correctly classified, i.e. true positives (TP) and True Negatives (TN), and wrongly predicted samples , i.e. false negatives (FN) and false positives (FP) for each class. The matrix can be displayed with absolute frequency values or normalized by each class total number of elements. The confusion matrix for the assignment are shown below:\nFrom the confusion matrix to assess the the quality of the predictions further evaluation metrics can be derived, a ranged from 0 to 1 (represents the best possible score):\nAccuracy: metric of all the correctly classified samples over the total number of samples that asses the overall performance of the model $$ Accuracy = …","date":1586908800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1586908800,"objectID":"7ac5abc037b564f1f3df5fad28fadcc9","permalink":"https://mariamonzon.com/project/text-classifier-bayes/","publishdate":"2020-04-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/text-classifier-bayes/","section":"project","summary":"Multinomial Bayes Text classifier to categorized financial transactions into seven types ","tags":["Machine Learning","Näive Bayes","Python","EDA","Open Source"],"title":"Financial Transaction  Text Clasifier","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"The goal of the project seminar is to implement an adaptive sampling strategy to dynamically tune the sampling rate of a wearable egocentric camera. The sampling rate will be tuned based on context measure, i.e., a measure of motion, extracted from the frames.\nThe increasing development new media and data acquisition techniques have lead to new innovative video recording set ups. A clear example of that is the egocentric video, where a camera on head or on the chest approximates the visual field of the camera wearer. This new camera setting offers a valuable perspective to understand user’s activities and their context. In this case, the wearable head-mounted egocentric camera set up pursued a dietary event spotting in a free living condition.\nA main feature of free-living data is a long recording duration. However, this kind of camera often acquire irrelevant data for the analysis task. In this work we introduce an adaptive sampling strategy to dynamically tune the sam- pling rate of a wearable egocentric camera. The adaptive sampling rate is based on a context measure. It is a motion measure, indicative if the recorded activity might be of our interest.\nTo evaluate the sampling strategy we implemented a computational simulation of resource consumption in terms of energy consumption and memory storage. For this purpose, I designed an analytical energy and memory model, a nd base our analysis on data extracted from datasheets. Our energy and memory model considers both sensing components, i.e., the cmos sensor, and processing, i.e., the microcontroller to process the deep neural network.\nThe clear advantage of an adaptive frame rate is saving energy as the camera will not be acquiring data continuously. Benefits from our method will be longer recording sessions, smaller battery employment or smaller storage space usage. This would help to overcome the limitations of the video recording, in terms of power consumption, while maintaining acceptable performance. Furthermore, less data acquisition will also mean an energy saving in processing.\n","date":1568505600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1568505600,"objectID":"a10e079881763d7b31f9ce0f39000d16","permalink":"https://mariamonzon.com/project/adaptive-frame-sampling/","publishdate":"2019-09-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/adaptive-frame-sampling/","section":"project","summary":"New adaptive sampling strategy based on a motion context measure for ego +centric video was developed.

Resuscitation guidelines recommend different treatments depending on the heart rhythm of the patient. The objective of this work is to develop a machine learning algorithm based on the ECG signal to automatically label heart rhythms in resuscitation episodes, a key tool for the retrospectively evaluation and improvement of the quality treatment. This work would help to systematise the annotation of databases since manual annotation of rhythms is a time-consuming task which can be an obstacle for handling large data sets.\nThe starting point of this project was a database composed of 1631 intervals of 3 seconds taken from a larger database containing OHCA 298 episodes. To review the ECG segments, a graphical interface (GUI) was developed which allows the display of the ECGs classified by the type of arrhythmia: asystole (AS), ventricular tachycardia (VT) that degenerates into ventricular fibrillation (VF), pulseless electrical activity (PEA) pulse generating rhythms (PR).\nThe database has been processed using a machine learning algorithm and the results obtained using cross-validation. Two classifiers have been developed selecting five features of the ECG, first to identify AS, and then to discriminate organised rhythms (PR and PEA) from ventricular arrhythmias (VT and VF).\nThese algorithms have been combined to create a three class rhythm classification algorithm. The total accuracy of the final algorithm was 90.9%. A precise algorithm was obtained for the classification of OHCA rhythm into: AS, organised, and shockable rhythms. This algorithm can be implemented to analyse resuscitation episodes using 3 seconds ECG segments, and could be integrated into new methods for retrospective analysis of OHCA.\nThe results show that it is possible to automatically interpret resuscitation cardiac rhythm. These types of algorithms can be very useful since they allow an efficient rhythm classification with a minimum level of expert clinician supervision\n","date":1461715200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1461715200,"objectID":"8b0593f6026895de14967694603442f2","permalink":"https://mariamonzon.com/project/ecg-annotation-svm-classifier/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/ecg-annotation-svm-classifier/","section":"project","summary":"B.Sc.
