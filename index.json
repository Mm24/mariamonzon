Therefore, the problem can be well modeled as a discrete-time Markov Decision Processes. The approach follow was:\nImplement a reinforcement-learning based algorithm The robot is the agent and decides where to place the next part Use the markov decision process toolbox for your solution Choose the best performing MDP Defitinions The basic concepts to understand the promblem are shortly introduced based on Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach book:\nReinforcement learning: Type of dynamic programming that trains algorithms using a system of reward and punishment. The agent learns without intervention from a human by maximizing its reward and minimizing its penalty and updates itself continuously. The algorithm it automatically finds patterns and relationships inside of that dataset. It requires realtime data.\nAgent: A is the set of all possible moves the agent can make. An action is almost self-explanatory, but it should be noted that agents choose among a list of possible actions.\nEnvironment: The world through which the agent moves. The environment takes the agent’s current state and action as input, and returns as output the agent’s reward and its next state.\nState: The parameter values that describe the current cofiguration of the environment, which the agent uses to choose an action. A state is a concrete and immediate situation in which the agent finds itself; i.e. a specific place and moment.\nReward: Feedback by which we effectively evaluate the agent’s action. From any given state, an agent sends output in the form of actions to the environment, and the environment returns the agent’s new state (which resulted from actingon the previous state) as well as rewards, if any. Rewards can be immediate or delayed.\nMarkov decision process: Markov decision processes (MDPS) is a model decision making in stochastic, sequential environments. The essence of the model is that a decision maker, or agent, inhabits an environment, which changes state randomly in response to action choices made by the agent. Example Introduction A tiny warehouse with (2x2) storage capacity locations is simulated. The picking robot (agent) interacts with the warehouse (environment) by store-restoring items in each warehouse cell or shelve. The dataset contains store and restore action for red, blue and white colored items although an empty field is also possible.\nWhen the agent is placed on a field position (𝑥𝑑, 𝑦𝑑), it can either store or restore each of the color items. There exists a total of six possible actions to change its environment. The robot can move in the (2x2) grid environment and start moving at initial grid position (1,1) . The robot is constrained to always to move only to one adjacent fields (not in diagonal).\nThe distance the robot needs to move is derived based on current (𝑥𝑐 , 𝑦𝑐 ) and goal position (𝑥𝑑 , 𝑦𝑑). The distance is calculated as the sum of the absolute differences of the layout position $$ 𝑑 = |𝑥_𝑑 − 𝑥_𝑐 | + |𝑦_𝑑 − 𝑦_𝑑|$$ Therefore, the distance to the position can be assigned to the cost of the action or negative reward. The ideal goal of the reinforcement learning approach would be to optimize the route picking storage strategy by minimizing the distance with rewards the store/restore motion actions.\nMethods The Markov Discrete Process (MDP) algorithm was implemented for modelling the problem. A MDP is described by state transition probabilities. A general Reinforcement Learning and thus also MDP algorithm is defined with a set of variables:\nActions (A): refers to the operations an agent can perform which direct modify the environment. In our problem this are related to the effect on the warehouse grid cells, directly proportional to the warehouse size (𝑋, 𝑌). $ A = \\{ 𝐴_{(1,1)}, 𝐴_{(1,2)}, 𝐴_{(2,1)}, … , 𝐴_{(X,Y)}\\}$ where $ |𝐴| = |𝑋 \\cdot 𝑌|$ .\nStates (S): represent all the possible configuration of environment, i.e, how the items are storage in the warehouse grid. In the addressed problem, the total states can be computed $ |S| = \\{𝑖𝑡𝑒𝑚𝑠_{𝑔𝑟𝑖𝑑}*move_{action} \\}$ where the items on the grid is calculated as the exponential relation of colored items number to grid size, and the move actions represent all the possible robot movements {store: blue/red/white, restore: blue/red/white }.\nTransition probability matrix (TMP) in Markov processes stores the probability to transition from the current state to a next possible state after the agent has performed given action in a single time unit. The dimension if this matrix is determined by (|𝐴|,|𝑆|,|𝑆|).\nReward matrix (R), is composed by the defined reward or symbolic benefit received performing and action 𝐴(𝑥,𝑦) for a given state. The shape of this matrix (|𝑆|,|𝐴|).\nTransition Probability Matrix (TPM) In the simple addressed problem, the warehouse grid is of size the 2x2.

Naive Bayes is a statistical classification technique based on Bayes probability theorem, considered as one most basic supervised learning algorithm. Naive Bayes classifier assumes that the features in a class are independent of other features. The followed approach to implement the classifier can be is based on the standard steps of Machine Learning (ML) algorithms: data exploration and preprocessing, feature selection and transformation, classifier model definition and training. The final phase of the assignment is dedicated for results visualization and evaluation.\nData exploration and preprocessing The essential first step is to import the dataset files into the python program, loaded as a pandas DataFrame data structure. The next step performed was a data quality assessment by printing the header columns, missing values datatypes and a short overview of the data samples. Furthermore, the unique values of each field as well as the label frequencies are printed to determine if the dataset suffers from class imbalance. As a quality assessment result, data cleaning procedures were performed. The missing values were substituted the missing values with 0, to minimize the effect of these on the accuracy of the model. For the text fields, the data was standardized by removing capital, special and/or punctuation characters, German stopwords and 2 or a single character-words. Finally, the sentences were splitted into single words (tokenize). After the data cleaning and preprocessing, to check if the process was done successfully, a final data inspection and a summary of the dataset by class was depicted. A secondary reason for the data inspection was to have an insight of the feature’s distributions and outlier identification.\nFeature transformation Feature transformation refers to translating the data into an appropriate format allowing the ML model to learn from the data. For instance, categorical data need to be converted to numerical data for the Naïve Bayes classifier. The categorical labels were converted to values ranged between 0-5. A common step in ML is also feature selection, i.e selection of the features in dataset hypothesized to be the most descriptive. Therefore, all the numeric values were scaled between the range 0-1 to reduce the variance. The string features were vectorized and concatenated to create the feature matrix. The final feature dimension was 502. As an optional step, a model selector of the best K features was also implemented for feature dimensionality reduction.\nModel Training The selected classifier model is a Multinomial Naïve bayes classifier implemented in the sklearn library. As only few data samples were available in the dataset, a cross validation scheme has been used for training and evaluation. The data was splitted in k=10 folds and with stratified sampling to mitigate the class imbalance. Note that even the predict phase was done in after fitting the classifier on the KFold iteration, but this does not interfere in the training process.\nEvaluation and Result visualization As stated previously, the data samples present in the datasheet are not many to test the robustness of the classifier a cross validation scheme has been used for evaluation. For each class, the predicted probabilities are plotted in the next figure. The probabilities for each sample are close to 1, which resembles the a extreme probability assignament of Naïve Bayes Classifier.\nIn order to quantified the performance of the classifier, many quantitative metrics were computed. The most common evaluation method in classification is the so-called confusion matrix. The Matrix is represented for a binary classification although it can be extended to multiclass problem. The matrix represents the relation between correctly classified, i.e. true positives (TP) and True Negatives (TN), and wrongly predicted samples , i.e. false negatives (FN) and false positives (FP) for each class. The matrix can be displayed with absolute frequency values or normalized by each class total number of elements. The confusion matrix for the assignment are shown below:\nFrom the confusion matrix to assess the the quality of the predictions further evaluation metrics can be derived, a ranged from 0 to 1 (represents the best possible score):\nAccuracy: metric of all the correctly classified samples over the total number of samples that asses the overall performance of the model $$ Accuracy = …","date":1618444800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1618444800,"objectID":"7ac5abc037b564f1f3df5fad28fadcc9","permalink":"https://mariamonzon.com/project/text-classifier-bayes/","publishdate":"2021-04-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/text-classifier-bayes/","section":"project","summary":"Reinforcement Learning algorithm for optimal-storing objects in a warehouse","tags":["Reinforcement Learning","Python","EDA"],"title":"Warehouse storing Route optimizaiton with Reinforcement Learning","type":"project"},{"authors":["Maria Monzon"],"categories":["Demo"],"content":"Overview The Wowchemy website builder for Hugo, along with its starter templates, is designed for professional creators, educators, and teams/organizations - although it can be used to create any kind of site The template can be modified and customised to suit your needs.

The objective this thesis 1 was to evaluate deep learning-based landmarks tracking methods to extract the motion of the mitral valves throughout the cardiac cycle on time-resolved CMR four-chamber- view (4CHV) images. The fully automated CNN based algorithm would improve the current slice following acquisition workflow, which needs from manual user intervention. The automatic imaging slice tracking will enable a more precise morphology and flow estimation, potentially improving the diagnosis of diastolic dysfunction. During this project, an automatic deep learning algorithm using landmark detection was developed.\nMotivation Cardio-vascular diseases remain the leading cause of death worldwide [1]. In particular, diastolic dys- function is an important cause of cardiac insufficiency, heart failure, potentially leading to premature cardiovascular death if not diagnosed and treated for at an early disease stage. Left ventricular dias- tolic dysfunction is estimated to affect from 27% to 43% in middle-aged adults [2] and its prevalence increases with age.\nDiastolic dysfunction is defined as a malfunctioning filling of the heart during diastole [3]. Its diag- nostic remains challenging as not only structural but functional abnormalities need to be evaluated [4]. Several non-invasive imaging techniques have been used for assessing diastolic dysfunction. Typically, intra-cardiac haemodynamics are measured using Doppler echocardiography. The peak velocities during early diastolic filling (E wave) and atrial contraction (A wave) are measured, and their ratio is calculated [5]. The Doppler flow measures are influenced by multiple factors including age, valve heart diseases, heart rate. Therefore, no single parameter is determinant enough to asses diastolic dysfunction [6].\nMagnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a noninvasive technique, well suited for disease diagnosis and monitoring due to its high spatial and temporal resolution and excellent soft-tissue contrast. In- deed, Cardiac Magnetic Resonance (CMR) provides information about heart structure and function, particularly in soft tissue characterization without the need of any contrast agent. Furthermore, CMR is useful for characterizing the anatomic valve morphology and cine images allows to visualize the valve throughout the cardiac cycle [7, 8]. Indeed, CMR allows assessment of blood flow using phase-contrast MRI (PC-MRI) [9].\nAs the valves move during a cardiac cycle, the acquisition of a fixed 2D slice will not allow the accurate time-resolved visualization of the valve and quantification of the blood flow: The valve moves into and out of the MRI slice so cannot be seen on each cardiac phase, therefore, the quantified flow through the valve is not correct. Despite the importance of correct valve flow assessment, time resolved CMR is yet usually performed at fixed slice positions throughout the cardiac cycle Kozerke et al. [10] introduced the prospective slice tracking concept. If the valve motion is known prior to the examina- tion, the slice position can be updated for each cardiac phase. As this approach however requires a dedicated pre-scan including an image-based algorithm to quantify the valve motion, very few related work can be found applying this technique in a clinical setting.\nThe recent development of deep learning has led to significant improvements in medical image analysis [11]. The prominent algorithms for feature tracking include deep learning systems based on convolutional neural network architectures. Specifically, for valve-tracking, a deep learning feature tracking algorithm for automatic slice-tracking can be developed, overcoming many limitations of the current valve-tracking techniques. The imaging slice tracking will enable a more precise morphology and flow estimation, potentially improving the diagnosis of diastolic dysfunction.\nDataset The dataset is composed of Cardiac Magnetic Resonance Imaging 4CHV CINE series from 87 patients extracted from the Cardiac Atlas Project [Fon11]. The imaging protocol included CINE images acquired in long-axis planes, but for our work we only selected the 4CHV long axis view. The sequence of 4CHV CINE CMR are acquired on multiple 1.5T MRI scanners from different vendors (Philips, Siemens, GE). The mean pixel spacing of all selected datasets is 1.49 + 0.28 mm/pixel. Additionally the annotated dataset contains anatomical landmarks, i.e. the mitral valve position at each temporal aframe nnotated by an experienced analyst. As a preprocessing step, the CINE series were interpolated into a fixed and temporal resolution and horizontally flipped to have all the images oriented with the apex of the heart upwards. Finally,the input images intensity were normalized to 0-1 range values. After cleaning the data, the dataset contain 87 series that are …","date":1593561600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1593561600,"objectID":"6999a576c29357de923fb6dd5082a3fb","permalink":"https://mariamonzon.com/project/valve-cardiac-motion-assesment/","publishdate":"2020-07-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/valve-cardiac-motion-assesment/","section":"project","summary":"M.Sc.

It is a motion measure, indicative if the recorded activity might be of our interest.\nTo evaluate the sampling strategy we implemented a computational simulation of resource consumption in terms of energy consumption and memory storage. For this purpose, I designed an analytical energy and memory model, a nd base our analysis on data extracted from datasheets. Our energy and memory model considers both sensing components, i.e., the cmos sensor, and processing, i.e., the microcontroller to process the deep neural network.\nThe clear advantage of an adaptive frame rate is saving energy as the camera will not be acquiring data continuously. Benefits from our method will be longer recording sessions, smaller battery employment or smaller storage space usage. This would help to overcome the limitations of the video recording, in terms of power consumption, while maintaining acceptable performance. Furthermore, less data acquisition will also mean an energy saving in processing.\n","date":1568505600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1568505600,"objectID":"6becbb22ceaaba9d5da862d2050ef36d","permalink":"https://mariamonzon.com/project/cardiac-parameter-extraction/","publishdate":"2019-09-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/cardiac-parameter-extraction/","section":"project","summary":"New adaptive sampling strategy based on a motion context measure for ego +centric video was developed.

Resuscitation guidelines recommend different treatments depending on the heart rhythm of the patient. The objective of this work is to develop a machine learning algorithm based on the ECG signal to automatically label heart rhythms in resuscitation episodes, a key tool for the retrospectively evaluation and improvement of the quality treatment. This work would help to systematise the annotation of databases since manual annotation of rhythms is a time-consuming task which can be an obstacle for handling large data sets.\nThe starting point of this project was a database composed of 1631 intervals of 3 seconds taken from a larger database containing OHCA 298 episodes. To review the ECG segments, a graphical interface (GUI) was developed which allows the display of the ECGs classified by the type of arrhythmia: asystole (AS), ventricular tachycardia (VT) that degenerates into ventricular fibrillation (VF), pulseless electrical activity (PEA) pulse generating rhythms (PR).\nThe database has been processed using a machine learning algorithm and the results obtained using cross-validation. Two classifiers have been developed selecting five features of the ECG, first to identify AS, and then to discriminate organised rhythms (PR and PEA) from ventricular arrhythmias (VT and VF).\nThese algorithms have been combined to create a three class rhythm classification algorithm. The total accuracy of the final algorithm was 90.9%. A precise algorithm was obtained for the classification of OHCA rhythm into: AS, organised, and shockable rhythms. This algorithm can be implemented to analyse resuscitation episodes using 3 seconds ECG segments, and could be integrated into new methods for retrospective analysis of OHCA.\nThe results show that it is possible to automatically interpret resuscitation cardiac rhythm. These types of algorithms can be very useful since they allow an efficient rhythm classification with a minimum level of expert clinician supervision\n","date":1461715200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1461715200,"objectID":"8b0593f6026895de14967694603442f2","permalink":"https://mariamonzon.com/project/ecg-annotation-svm-classifier/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/ecg-annotation-svm-classifier/","section":"project","summary":"Implement a GUI to help ECG annotations and develop a machine learning algorithm to retrospectively classify arrhythmia based on 5 best ECG features","tags":["Machine Learning","SVM","ECG","MATLAB","Research"],"title":"ECG-based algorithm for Annotation of Resuscitation Episode","type":"project"}]
