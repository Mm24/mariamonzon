      <title>Fully automatic extraction of mitral valve annulus motion parameters on long axis CINE CMR using deep learning</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Diastolic dysfunction is an important cause of cardiac insuf-
ficiency, defined as a malfunctioning filling of the heart during diastole.
The analysis of mitral valve motion is known to be relevant in the diagno-
sis of cardiac dysfunction. Cardiac motion parameters can be extracted
from Cardiac Magnetic Resonance (CMR) images. However, in clinical
setting valve motion modeling usually needs a manual intervention to lo-
calize the valvular plane. We propose two chained Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNN) for automatic tracking of mitral valve-annulus land-
marks on time-resolved 2-chamber and 4-chamber CMR images. 
The first CNN is trained to detect the region of interest and the second to
track the landmarks along the cardiac cycle. The presented deep learn-
ing system has high accuracy in terms of temporal landmark tracking
and motion assessment. Furthermore, we successfully extracted several
motion-related parameters thereby overcoming time-consuming annota-
tion and allowing statistical analysis over a large number of datasets.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Assessment of cardiac valve motion on time-resolved MRI images using deep learning</title>
      <link>https://mariamonzon.com/project/valve-cardiac-motion-assesment/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The presented work aimed to develop a novel method for the task of valve motion
assessment for prospective slice tracking in CMR temporal image (CINE) acquisition. 
The objective this thesis &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; was to evaluate deep learning-based landmarks tracking methods to extract the
motion of the mitral valves throughout the cardiac cycle on time-resolved CMR four-chamber-
view (4CHV) images. The fully automated CNN based algorithm would improve the current slice following acquisition workflow, which needs from manual user intervention. 
The automatic imaging slice tracking will enable a more precise morphology and flow estimation, potentially
improving the diagnosis of diastolic dysfunction. During this project, an automatic deep learning algorithm using landmark detection was developed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;motivation&#34;&gt;Motivation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cardio-vascular diseases remain the leading cause of death worldwide [1]. In particular, diastolic dys-
function is an important cause of cardiac insufficiency, heart failure, potentially leading to premature
cardiovascular death if not diagnosed and treated for at an early disease stage. Left ventricular dias-
tolic dysfunction is estimated to affect from 27% to 43% in middle-aged adults [2] and its prevalence
increases with age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diastolic dysfunction is defined as a malfunctioning filling of the heart during diastole [3]. Its diag-
nostic remains challenging as not only structural but functional abnormalities need to be evaluated [4].
Several non-invasive imaging techniques have been used for assessing diastolic dysfunction.
Typically, intra-cardiac haemodynamics are measured using Doppler echocardiography. The peak
velocities during early diastolic filling (E wave) and atrial contraction (A wave) are measured, and their
ratio is calculated [5]. The Doppler flow measures are influenced by multiple factors including age,
valve heart diseases, heart rate. Therefore, no single parameter is determinant enough to asses diastolic
dysfunction [6].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a noninvasive technique, well suited for disease diagnosis
and monitoring due to its high spatial and temporal resolution and excellent soft-tissue contrast. In-
deed, Cardiac Magnetic Resonance (CMR) provides information about heart structure and function,
particularly in soft tissue characterization without the need of any contrast agent. Furthermore, CMR
is useful for characterizing the anatomic valve morphology and cine images allows to visualize the valve
throughout the cardiac cycle [7, 8]. Indeed, CMR allows assessment of blood flow using phase-contrast
MRI (PC-MRI) [9].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the valves move during a cardiac cycle, the acquisition of a fixed 2D slice will not allow the
accurate time-resolved visualization of the valve and quantification of the blood flow: The valve moves
into and out of the MRI slice so cannot be seen on each cardiac phase, therefore, the quantified flow
through the valve is not correct. Despite the importance of correct valve flow assessment, time resolved
CMR is yet usually performed at fixed slice positions throughout the cardiac cycle Kozerke et al. [10]
introduced the prospective slice tracking concept. If the valve motion is known prior to the examina-
tion, the slice position can be updated for each cardiac phase. As this approach however requires a
dedicated pre-scan including an image-based algorithm to quantify the valve motion, very few related
work can be found applying this technique in a clinical setting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The recent development of deep learning has led to significant improvements in medical image
analysis [11]. The prominent algorithms for feature tracking include deep learning systems based on
convolutional neural network architectures. Specifically, for valve-tracking, a deep learning feature
tracking algorithm for automatic slice-tracking can be developed, overcoming many limitations of the
current valve-tracking techniques. The imaging slice tracking will enable a more precise morphology
and flow estimation, potentially improving the diagnosis of diastolic dysfunction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;dataset&#34;&gt;Dataset&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dataset is composed of Cardiac Magnetic Resonance Imaging 4CHV CINE series from 87
patients extracted from the Cardiac Atlas Project [Fon11]. The imaging protocol included CINE
images acquired in long-axis planes, but for our work we only selected the 4CHV long axis view.
The sequence of 4CHV CINE CMR are acquired on multiple 1.5T MRI scanners from
different vendors (Philips, Siemens, GE). The mean pixel spacing of all selected datasets
is 1.49 + 0.28 mm/pixel. Additionally the annotated dataset contains anatomical landmarks, i.e.
the mitral valve position at each temporal aframe nnotated by an experienced analyst. 
As a preprocessing step, the CINE series were interpolated into a fixed and temporal resolution and
horizontally flipped to have all the images oriented with the apex of the heart upwards. Finally,the
input images intensity were normalized to 0-1 range values. After cleaning the data, the dataset
contain 87 series that are split into 70% for training and the rest 30% equally between test and
validation. To increase the variability of the dataset, online data augmentation was performed
when training the network in forms of shift, center cropping, rotation, Guassian noise addition,
contrast enhancement and Gaussian blurring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://mariamonzon.com/images/valve-cardiac-motion-assesment/data-exampleslice.png&#34; alt=&#34;data-visualization&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;system-overview&#34;&gt;System Overview&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The motion assesment system is composed of four main stages. The preprocessed CINE dataset are forwarded as input to a convolutional based neural network (CNN).
The final proposed system comprises two chained CNNs based on heatmap regression approach: Localization Network + Landmark Detection Network. The task of the localization CNN model is to detect the landmarks only in the first temporal frame of the full 4CHV CINE series. The complete system is designed to regress the mitral valve-annulus landmarks for each time-frame points. 
Finally, the valvular plane motion can be derived from the two predicted landmark distance. The predicted temporal coordinates are translated into mm-space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;















&lt;figure  &gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;d-flex justify-content-center&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://mariamonzon.com/images/valve-cardiac-motion-assesment/system-overview.png&#34; alt=&#34;results-visualization&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;results&#34;&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evaluated heatmap based regression approach for landmark detection yields to a superior performance than direct coordinate regression.Especially, the motion is better modeled by the two-stages architectures than with 3-D instead
of single network. The proposed system showed an accurate match between expert-annotated
and automatically detected landmarks for each time-frame. An example results of the model is shown in the below figure:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;















&lt;figure  &gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;d-flex justify-content-center&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://mariamonzon.com/images/valve-cardiac-motion-assesment/results-motion-curves.png&#34; alt=&#34;results-visualization&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

The complete system has an accuracy of 1.66+- 0.75 mm. The roughness metric has a similar value as the ground truth annotations R = 0.085 +- 0.045 and the total slope variation value is TVslope = 0.53 +- 0.28.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our proposed method allows landmark localization with sub-pixel accuracy. Experiments
show that our approach is able to correctly locate the landmark which can assess the prospective
slice tracking acquisition method. The results of this work can be summarized as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CNNs can be used to develop a time-resolved landmark tracking application without the
need of any user interaction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Heart landmark detection with the deep learning results can be improved by means of regressing heatmaps.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The proposed two-stages method further allows a more accurate localization.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A post-processing step with the non-linear least square fitting is able to refine the landmark
location. The additional step outputs subpixel maxima and therefore predicts a smooth
motion.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion-and-outlook&#34;&gt;Conclusion and Outlook&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proposed system enables the valve tracking detection over time and therefore smooth valve motion assessment. 
Future work would focus on extension on the algorithm to 2CHV valve landmark detection. Evaluation with more test data
and further refinement of the network. An integration of a single CNN could be convenient for faster inference time. Finally, when the validity of the method is proved , the scanner integration would be the next step.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Adaptive Frame Rate for Egocentric Video</title>
      <link>https://mariamonzon.com/project/adaptive-frame-sampling/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 15 Sep 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://mariamonzon.com/project/adaptive-frame-sampling/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The goal of the project seminar is to implement an adaptive sampling strategy to dynamically
tune the sampling rate of a wearable egocentric camera. The sampling rate will be tuned
based on context measure, i.e., a measure of motion, extracted from the frames.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The increasing development new media and data acquisition techniques have lead to new
innovative video recording set ups. A clear example of that is the egocentric video, where
a camera on head or on the chest approximates the visual field of the camera wearer.
This new camera setting offers a valuable perspective to understand user&amp;rsquo;s activities and
their context. In this case, the wearable head-mounted egocentric camera set up pursued
a dietary event spotting in a free living condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A main feature of free-living data is a long recording duration. However, this kind of
camera often acquire irrelevant data for the analysis task.
In this work we introduce an adaptive sampling strategy to dynamically tune the sam-
pling rate of a wearable egocentric camera. The adaptive sampling rate is based on a
context measure. It is a motion measure, indicative if the recorded activity might be of
our interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To evaluate the sampling strategy we implemented a computational simulation of resource consumption in terms of energy consumption and memory storage. For this purpose, I designed an analytical energy and memory model, a
nd base our analysis on data extracted from datasheets. Our energy and memory model considers
both sensing components, i.e., the cmos sensor, and processing, i.e., the microcontroller
to process the deep neural network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The clear advantage of an adaptive frame rate is saving energy as the camera will not be
acquiring data continuously. 
Benefits from our method will be longer recording sessions, smaller battery employment or smaller
storage space usage. This would help to overcome the limitations of the video recording,
in terms of power consumption, while maintaining acceptable performance. 
Furthermore, less data acquisition will also mean an energy saving in processing.&lt;/p&gt;
