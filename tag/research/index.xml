      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accurate segmentation of myocardial pathological tissue from cardiac magnetic resonance images (CMR), such as scar tissue and edema, f is crutial to the assessment of the severity of myocardial infarction (MI).
CMRis the gold standar to provide anatomical and functional information of heart. Specifically, late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) CMR sequence which is used to diagnosis MI, the T2-weighted CMR which resembles ischemic regions, and the balanced- Steady State Free Precession (bSSFP) cine sequence which captures cardiac motions . Combining these multi-sequence CMR data could provide reliable information regarding to the pathological as well as morphological information of the myocardium &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sdspeople.fudan.edu.cn/zhuangxiahai/0/myops20/index.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;data&#34;&gt;Data&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The input dataset  contains 45 cases of multi-sequence CMR from Myops2020 challenge &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sdspeople.fudan.edu.cn/zhuangxiahai/0/myops20/index.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;









. Each case refers to a patient with three sequence CMR, i.e., LGE, T2 and bSSFP CMR. All these clinical data have got institutional ethic approval and have been anonymized.
The “masks” folder contains 45 cases of multi-sequence CMR, where each mask represents the segmentation map of the the corresponding CMR Slice image:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Label 1: normal myocardium&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Label 2: edema&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Label 3: scar&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Label 0: Background&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proposed approach involves a two-staged network. First a heatmap-based regression architecture was train to detect a small ROI and locate the myocardium, based on , in order to reduce task complexity. Sequentially a a U-Net based neural network was train to perform  multi-modal pathological region segmentation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Adaptive Frame Rate for Egocentric Video</title>
      <link>https://mariamonzon.com/project/adaptive-frame-sampling/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 15 Sep 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://mariamonzon.com/project/adaptive-frame-sampling/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The goal of the project seminar is to implement an adaptive sampling strategy to dynamically
tune the sampling rate of a wearable egocentric camera. The sampling rate will be tuned
based on context measure, i.e., a measure of motion, extracted from the frames.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The increasing development new media and data acquisition techniques have lead to new
innovative video recording set ups. A clear example of that is the egocentric video, where
a camera on head or on the chest approximates the visual field of the camera wearer.
This new camera setting offers a valuable perspective to understand user&amp;rsquo;s activities and
their context. In this case, the wearable head-mounted egocentric camera set up pursued
a dietary event spotting in a free living condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A main feature of free-living data is a long recording duration. However, this kind of
camera often acquire irrelevant data for the analysis task.
In this work we introduce an adaptive sampling strategy to dynamically tune the sam-
pling rate of a wearable egocentric camera. The adaptive sampling rate is based on a
context measure. It is a motion measure, indicative if the recorded activity might be of
our interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To evaluate the sampling strategy we implemented a computational simulation of resource consumption in terms of energy consumption and memory storage. For this purpose, I designed an analytical energy and memory model, a
nd base our analysis on data extracted from datasheets. Our energy and memory model considers
both sensing components, i.e., the cmos sensor, and processing, i.e., the microcontroller
to process the deep neural network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The clear advantage of an adaptive frame rate is saving energy as the camera will not be
acquiring data continuously. 
Benefits from our method will be longer recording sessions, smaller battery employment or smaller
storage space usage. This would help to overcome the limitations of the video recording,
in terms of power consumption, while maintaining acceptable performance. 
Furthermore, less data acquisition will also mean an energy saving in processing.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>ECG-based algorithm for Annotation of Resuscitation Episode</title>
      <link>https://mariamonzon.com/project/ecg-annotation-svm-classifier/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 27 Apr 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://mariamonzon.com/project/ecg-annotation-svm-classifier/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Out-of hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) is one of the major causes of death in developed countries. Resuscitation guidelines recommend different treatments depending on the heart rhythm of the patient. The objective of this work is to develop a machine learning algorithm based on the ECG signal to automatically label heart rhythms in resuscitation episodes, a key tool for the retrospectively evaluation and improvement of the quality treatment. This work would help to systematise the annotation of databases since manual annotation of rhythms is a time-consuming task which can be an obstacle for handling large data sets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The starting point of this project was a database composed of 1631 intervals of 3 seconds taken from a larger database containing OHCA 298 episodes. To review the ECG segments, a graphical interface (GUI) was developed which allows the display of the ECGs classified by the type of arrhythmia: 
asystole (AS), ventricular tachycardia (VT) that degenerates into ventricular fibrillation (VF), pulseless electrical activity (PEA) pulse generating rhythms (PR).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;















&lt;figure  &gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;d-flex justify-content-center&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://mariamonzon.com/images/egc-svm-annotation/GUI-visualization.png&#34; alt=&#34;GUI-example-visualization&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The database has been processed using a machine learning algorithm and the results obtained using cross-validation. Two classifiers have been developed selecting five features of the ECG, first to identify AS, and then to discriminate organised rhythms (PR and PEA) from ventricular arrhythmias (VT and VF).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;















&lt;figure  &gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;d-flex justify-content-center&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://mariamonzon.com/images/egc-svm-annotation/ECG-classification-Example.png&#34; alt=&#34;ECG-Visualization&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These algorithms have been combined to create a three class rhythm classification algorithm. The total accuracy of the final algorithm was 90.9%. A precise algorithm was obtained for the classification of OHCA rhythm into: AS, organised,  and  shockable  rhythms.  This  algorithm  can  be  implemented  to  analyse resuscitation episodes using 3 seconds ECG segments, and could be integrated into new methods for retrospective analysis of OHCA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;















&lt;figure  &gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;d-flex justify-content-center&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://mariamonzon.com/images/egc-svm-annotation/SVM-classification-results.png&#34; alt=&#34;ECG-Visualization&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results show that it is possible to automatically  interpret  resuscitation  cardiac  rhythm. These types of algorithms can be very useful since they allow an efficient rhythm classification with a minimum level of expert clinician supervision&lt;/p&gt;
